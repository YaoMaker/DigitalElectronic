The second part is to bulid a wireless remote control or use a smartphone to control the spider robot. 

Three Sensors

PIR sensors are used to detect motion from pets/humanoids from about 20 feet away.PIRs are basically made of a pyroelectric sensor. The sensor in a motion detector is actually split in two halves. 

IR detectors are little microchips with a photocell that are tuned to listen to infrared light. They are almost always used for remote control. IR detectors are specially filtered for Infrared light, they are not good at detecting visible light. IR detectors are digital out - either they detect 38KHz IR signal and output low (0V) or they do not detect any and output high (5V). 

Photocells are sensors that allow you to detect light.

# WEEK 3

## concept 
A devices that helps people to wake up or fall asleep with light and sound. The device will help a person fall asleep by synchronizing one's breathing with the variations of light and sound. Here is similar prodect  https://www.mydodow.com/en but only works with light.
In my version, the light will be controled by photocell sensor.
